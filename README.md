#REcon 2018

This presentation will talk about how custom Southbridge silicon, responsibe for background downloads while main SoC is off, didnâ€™t help to secure Playstation 4. It will explain how a chain of exploits combined with hardware attacks will allow code to run in the context of the secure bootloader, extract private keys, and sign a custom kernel.
